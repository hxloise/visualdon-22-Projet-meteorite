2006;Daniel Powter;Bad Day;gH476CxJxfg;"Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves, and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue sky's faded to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, ""don't lie""
You work at a smile, and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down, and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carrying on
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, ""don't lie""
You work at a smile, and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing, it turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah)
So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You see what you like
And how does it feel one more time?
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day"
2007;Rihanna;Umbrella;CvBfHwUxHIk;"Uh huh, uh huh
Yeah, Rihanna
Uh huh, uh huh
Good girl gone bad
Uh huh, uh huh
Take three, action
Uh huh, uh huh, Hov
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Comin' down at the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Rocafella
We fly higher than weather
In G5s or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day
Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?
You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
These fancy things will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the world has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
(There's no distance in between our love)
So gon' and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because
When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
It's raining, raining
Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
Baby, come into me
Come into me
It's raining, raining
Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
You can always come into me
Come into me
It's pouring rain
It's pouring rain
Come into me
Come into me
It's pouring rain
It's pouring rain"

Let it rain, mm-mm-mm
Let me talk to 'em
C'mon
Shawty had them apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a slap (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Hey, I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night, spending my dough
Had the million dollar vibe and a body to go
Them birthday cakes, they stole the show
So sexual
She was flexible, professional
Drinkin' X and O
Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I-, whoa
Did her thing, I seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bankroll
I'ma say that I prefer the no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her more
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it go
She had them apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a slap (ayy)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans filled with guap and they ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make your moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon, three stacks c'mon
Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playin'? Baby-girl, I'm the man
I invented rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulders
I knew it was over
That Henny and Cola got me like a soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky, oh, me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry, but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her
Apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a slap (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Whoa, shawty, yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin', and make me want it
Two in the morning, I'm zoned in
Them Rosay bottles foaming
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock
Apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a slap (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low (c'mon)"

2010;B.o.B  feat. Hayley Williams of Paramore;Airplanes;kn6-c223DUU;"Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're starin' at the phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for, if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back then I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before when I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur, what's up Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hoping we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
I could really use a wish right now
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shootin' stars
I, I, I could, I could really use a wish right now
A wish, a wish right now"
2011;Katy Perry;Firework;QGJuMBdaqIw;"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, make your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon"

Can't stop (we're higher than a motherfucker)
Jump in my hoopty, hoopty, hoop, I own that
And I ain't paying my rent this month, I owe that
But fuck who you want and fuck who you like
Dancehall life, there's no end in sight

Now everybody, let me hear you say ray, ray, ray
Go spend all your money 'cause today payday
And if you're a G, you a G, G, G
